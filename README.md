# visible_light_spectrum


Light is energy travelling in the form of electromagnetic waves.

It travels via waves of various wavelengths.

Visible light is the portion of the spectrum of electromagnetic waves which can be perceived by human eyes.

The visible spectrum range is from about 380 nm to 700 nm [nanometers (10-9)].

Human eyes perceive different wavelengths of light in the form of colors. This does not mean that the light is of that color, it’s just that it is perceived by human eyes in that way.

Issac Newton gave 7 colors from his prism experiment as he thought 7 was the ‘lucky’ number.

Actual/True colors -- Violet | Blue | Cyan | Green | Yellow | Orange | Red

Painter’s color palette has three primary colors -- Red, Blue and Yellow since there is no substance to create green pigment. Green is made by mixing Yellow and Blue. Also, mixing all colors gives black color -- Subtractive model.

Actual/True/Eye colors -- Red, Green and Blue since we have red, green and blue cone receptors for color/wavelength (in more correct terms) identification and rod receptors for catching the intensity of light.

Color facts: -

Red -- Easy to transition to dark/ Night light for low presence.

Green -- Most green receptors in eyes. Hence, most identified and sensitive color to the human eye. We pick up more shades of green, and is also used for 
increasing concentration.

Blue -- Good for wakefulness, as they stimulate the melanopsin receptors (night time receptors) and give rest to melatonin (day time receptors).

True Colors Primary -- Red, Blue, Green

True Colors Secondary -- Cyan, Magenta, Yellow.

True Colors, when all combined, give white light -- Additive model.

Wavelength chart: -

Color -- Wavelength (nanometers -- nm -- 10-9)

Violet -- 380-450

Blue -- 450-485

Cyan -- 485-500

Green -- 500-565

Yellow  -- 565-590

Orange -- 590-625

Red -- 625-700

[These ranges vary from person to person, but are close to this range]

Frequency, wavelength and speed of light (electromagnetic waves): -

c=λf

Speed of light = (Wavelength) X (Frequency)[constant]

Speed of light in vacuum (c) = 3 x 10-8 m/s

Speed and Wavelength of light changes per medium

Speed of light in medium (v) = c / n …[n = Refractive index of the medium]

Energy 0f photon (light particle): -

E = hf

Planck's constant = h = 6.626 x 10-34 Joules.second

Energy of light is often measured in electron volts as ‘it fits in a certain bracket of calculations’.

1 Electron volt (eV) = 1.602 x 10-19 Joules

∴ E = (hf) / (1.602 x 10-19) eV
